Add a `example` key to data/home.toml:

```toml
example = "I'm a slide"
```
<br>

Set the `content` attribute to "home.example":

```markdown
{{< slide content="home.example" >}}
```

---

ğŸ’¡ Each data template entry can contain one or more slides, separated by `---` with newlines.

---

ğŸ’¡ All other slide shortcode attributes (background, transition, etc.) can be used and will be applied to each slide in the data template entry.

---

ğŸ’¡ Adding a new file in `data` folder requires to restart `hugo`

ğŸ’¡ Symbolic links are not allowed in `data` folder
