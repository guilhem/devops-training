[![Cargo Cult](/cargo_cult.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)

{{% note %}}

The term cargo cult as an idiom, originally referred to aboriginal religions that grew up in the South Pacific after World War II. The practices of these groups centered on building elaborate mock-ups of airplanes and military landing strips in the hope of summoning the god-like airplanes that had brought marvelous cargo during the war. Use of the term in computer programming probably derives from Richard Feynman's characterization of certain practices as cargo cult science.
