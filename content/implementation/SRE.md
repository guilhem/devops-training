"specific implementation of DevOps with some idiosyncratic extensions."

---

SRE is "what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations."

---

> Hope is not a strategy

---

50% ops (issues, on-call, and manual intervention)

50% development tasks (new features, scaling or automation)

---

## Reduce organizational silos

- SRE shares ownership with developers to create shared responsibility
- SREs use the same tools that developers use, and vice versa

---

## Implement gradual changes

- SRE encourages developers and product owners to move quickly by reducing the cost of failure

---

## Leverage tooling and automation

- SREs have a charter to automate menial tasks (called "toil") away

---

## Measure everything

- SRE defines prescriptive ways to measure values
- SRE fundamentally believes that systems operation is a software problem
