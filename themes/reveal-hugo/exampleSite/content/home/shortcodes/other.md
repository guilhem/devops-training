## Notes

Add speaker notes (with markdown) to your presentation with the `note` shortcode. Type 's' to see this slide's speaker notes.

```markdown
---

{{%/* note */%}}
- You found the **speaker notes**!
{{%/* /note */%}}

---
```

{{% note %}}
- You found the **speaker notes**!
{{% /note %}}

---

{{< slide notes="You found the notes!" >}}

## Notes

You can also add notes with the `slide` shortcode and `notes` attribute:

```markdown
---

{{%/* slide notes="You found the notes!" */%}}

---
```
